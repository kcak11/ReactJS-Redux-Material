        Object Orientation is a software development paradigm that follows real-world modelling. 
        Object Orientation, considers a  program as a collection of objects that communicates with 
        each other via mechanism called methods.

        Object-Oriented Programming Concepts  
         ------------------------------------------

Object: An object is a real-time representation of any entity. According to Grady Brooch, every object is said to have 3 features:  
    o State: Described by the attributes of an object.  
    o Behavior: Describes how the object will act.  
    o Identity: A unique value that distinguishes an object from a set of similar such objects.  

Class: A class in terms of OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data for the object.  

Method: Methods facilitate communication between objects.
